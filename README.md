# Open Source Bootstrap Component Catalog

The project aims to allow users to browse and share their bootstrap components. We all know how difficult it can be to quickly start prototyping an application and how much time goes into the design thinking rather than into the business logic of the site/app. 

This open source application will allow users around the globe to upload their bootstrap creations, each component needs to be made out of bootstrap CSS only. Each component will be categorized so any users who browse for components will be able to quickly and effectively grab what they need in copy paste fashion.
